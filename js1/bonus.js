// ---- Bonus Challenge If You Finish Early -----

// Guessing game - let the user enter a number 1 and 10 and generate a secret random number. If their number matches the random number, congratulate them.

/* PART ONE
Accomplish the above task with hardcoded dummy variables for the ‘guess’ is to make sure your logic works. You’ll need the following 
    Variables/inputs
        - Random Number: Variable that generates a random number.
        - Right User Guess: Variables that represents a right user guess. You will need to make it equal to the random number variable.
        - Wrong User Guess: A variable that represents a wrong user guess. Put in a wrong number here.
    Outputs:
        - If the right guess variable is given, the message: "Congratulations! You guessed the number!"
        - If the wrong guess variable is given, the message: "Sorry, better luck next time." */








/* PART TWO
Update the above code to take in a user’s input (guess) rather than using hardcoded variable values.
 
There are two ways you may choose to accomplish this, and both will require some research one your part!

Option 1: 
    - Run in the browser console environment, use prompt() and Document.write to gain user input and output to the browser.
Option 2: 
    - Run in the node command line /terminal environment (on your computer), which uses a node package called readline-sync to allow the user to input answers in the terminal and not have to use the browser. 
    - To Install: npm install readline-sync --save 	
    - To Use in JS File: require(‘readline-sync’);
    - To gain user input: readlineSync.question();
    - Output in console: console.log(); */
